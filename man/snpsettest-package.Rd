\title{snpsettest: A Set-Based Association Test using GWAS Summary Statistics}
\description{
The goal of 'snpsettest' is to provide simple tools that perform set-based association tests (e.g., gene-based association tests) using GWAS (genome-wide association study) summary statistics. A set-based association test in this package is based on the statistical model described in VEGAS (versatile gene-based association study), which combines the effects of a set of SNPs accounting for linkage disequilibrium between markers. This package uses a different approach from the original VEGAS implementation to compute set-level p values more efficiently, as described in \url{https://github.com/HimesGroup/snpsettest/wiki/Statistical-test-in-snpsettest}.
