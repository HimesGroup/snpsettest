Description: The goal of 'snpsettest' is to provide simple tools that perform
             set-based association tests (e.g., gene-based association tests)
             using GWAS (genome-wide association study) summary statistics. A
             set-based association test in this package is based on the
             statistical model described in VEGAS (versatile gene-based
             association study), which combines the effects of a set of SNPs
             accounting for linkage disequilibrium between markers. This package
             uses a different approach from the original VEGAS implementation to
             compute set-level p values more efficiently, as described in
             <https://github.com/HimesGroup/snpsettest/wiki/Statistical-test-in-snpsettest>.
